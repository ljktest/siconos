\section doxyKernelIntro Introduction

Siconos is a free (GNU license) software, dedicated to modeling, simulation and control of Non Smooth Dynamical Systems. 

This API documentation is automatically generated from the software sources (.h and .cpp) thanks to doxygen tools. 
You can also find other tools and documents (installation guide, tutorial ...) on \ref siconosHomePage "Siconos Home Page" (see tabs list on top of this page).\n 

To get and install the platform Siconos, see \ref <a href="https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=9">Download Section</a>.\n

\section sectplat Platforms

Siconos v2.1.0 has been successfully compiled on the following platforms:
- Linux/Unix gcc2.95.x, gcc3.x, gcc4.x
- Mac OS X (note: this platform required to set 
  FLIBS="-L/sw/lib -lfrtbegin -lg2c -lSystem" before 
  the ./configure completed successfully.)

If you have compiled Siconos on another platform successfully, then
the maintainer would be glad to hear about that.
