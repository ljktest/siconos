----------------------------------------------

A complete Installation Guide is available at
siconos.gforge.inria.fr/SiconosInstall/index.html.

---++ Required external libraries

   * libxml2
      * actual version used with the platform : 2.6.17
      * last version : 2.6.17 
      * known problems : none
      * location : http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html

   * Atlas
 	
---++ Optional external libraries (advised for developers)

   * cppunit
      * last version used with the platform: 1.12
      * location : http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi

   * Boost
      * actual version used with the platform: 1.34.1
      * last version : 1.34.1
      * known problems : none

      * location :
        http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586

      * you can read the "quick installation notes of Boost" at the
        end of this document

---++ Getting the sources

   * Through the svn server (access required)
       svn checkout svn+ssh://user@scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/siconos
       for more explanation see http://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=9
   * Download the source packages on the Gforge   


---++ INSTALL with cmake

The command `cmake' is needed (http://www.cmake.org/).
The compilation is done out of the source directory:

   * create a build directory <build>
   * cd <build>
   * cmake <path of the source directory> [CMAKE OPTIONS]
   * make [MAKE OPTIONS]
   * make test
   * make install

Some CMAKE OPTIONS that may be usefull:

   * to find include headers in specific directories :
     -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=<DIR>

     use a semicolon to separate directories (and not a colon!!):
     -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH="<DIR1>;<DIR2>;.."


   * to find libraries in specific directories :
     -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=<DIR> 

     for several directories, see above.


   * to build a debug library (compilation with -g) :
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

   * to build an optimized library (-O3 -DNDEBUG) (this is the
     default) : 
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release


   * to build the documentation, if you are under svn 
     -DWITH_DOCUMENTATION=TRUE -DWITH_SVN=TRUE
     the documentation is generated under GeneratedDocs directory
     (under your source directory!)

   * to build the documentation, if you are not under svn
     -DWITH_DOCUMENTATION=TRUE -DDOXYGEN_OUPUT=/some/where
     (you may have to create the directory /some/where/Tags)

   * to see cmake state : -DPRINT_ENV=1

   * to print a cmake variable : -DPRINT_VAR=VAR_NAME



        

Some MAKE OPTIONS that may be usefull:
   * to see make command as executed : VERBOSE=1

      
---+++ Is the installation of the Kernel OK ?

   * You can try to run : 

   cd /path/to/your/source/code/sample/Mechanics/BouncingBall ; siconos BouncingBall.cpp

---+++ Is the installation of the Front-End OK ?
   * You can try to run : 

   cd /path/to/your/source/code/sample/Mechanics/BouncingBall ; pySiconos BouncingBall.py

 Quick installation notes for BOOST  
----------------------------------------------

   * Download Boost at
      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586
   
   * Download bjam. The recommended way to get Boost.Jam if you are
      using a Boost distribution is to download a prebuilt executable
      from
      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=72941.
   
   * Type in the Boost directory: /the/path/of/BOOST-JAM/bjam install
      (as root) The default installation is /usr/local.
