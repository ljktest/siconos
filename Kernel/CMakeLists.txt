  "The present package, Siconos/Kernel, is dedicated to the modeling
and the simulation of Non Smooth Dynamical Systems (NSDS), with high
level description and numerical solving strategies.  It relies on
Siconos/Numerics which provides low-level algorithms to compute basic
well-identified problems.")
