This project belongs to the European project SICONOS, dedicated to the modeling, the control the analysis and the simulation of the so-called 
``Non Smooth Dynamical system'' NSDS. More details on this European project can be found on the website of the Project http://siconos.inrialpes.fr.

Besides the standard features which are required for a software of scientific computing, the objectives of this project are of the following :

        * To provide a common framework (modeling and simulation tools) for non smooth problems present in various scientific fields :
		 applied Mathematics, Mechanics, Robotics, Electrical networks, etc.
        * To be able to rely on existing developments, as well for the modeling tools as for the simulation tools. 
	  The platform will not re-implement the dedicated tools, which are already used for the modeling of specific systems in various fields,
          but will provide a framework to their integration. In the same way, we want to re-use improved numerical low-level routines.
        * To support exchanges and comparisons of methods between researchers.
        * To disseminate the know-how to other fields of research and industry.
        * To take into account the diversity of users (end users, experts, software developers, framework builders, industrial users, etc ... ).
        * To set up standards in terms of modeling of the NSDS.
        * To ensure software quality by the use of modern software design methods.

The present package, Siconos/Kernel, is dedicated to the modeling and the simulation of  NSDS, with high level description and numerical solving strategies.
It relies on Siconos/Numerics which provides low-level algorithms to compute basic well-identified problems.

More details are available on software documentation pages, Doc/Devel directory of the current distribution, in "design" chapter,
or on http://siconos.gforge.inria.fr/
