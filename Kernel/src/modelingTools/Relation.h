/** General Non Linear Relation (Virtual Base class for Relations).
 *  \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
 *  \version 3.0.0.
 *  \date (Creation) Apr 27, 2004
 *
 *  A relation is a link between global variables of the Dynamical Systems and
 * some local ones, named y and lambda; belonging to one and only one Interaction.
 *
 * The present class is an interface to all relations provides tools to define and describe them.
 *
 * Each relation must have the two following functions:
 *
 *  - computeOutput(...) to compute y using DS global variables.
 *  - computeInput(...) to compute non-smooth DS part (r or p) using lambda.
 *
 * Depending on the DS class and the link type, various relations (ie derived classes) are available:
 *   - FirstOrder, for FirstOrderDS and derived classes.
 *   - Lagrangian, for LagrangianDS and derived classes.
 *
 *  The specific type (Linear, Scleronomous ...) is then given by the "subType". See Relation derived classes for details.
 *
 * The relation holds also:
 *  - a pointer to the Interaction that owns the present relation.
 *  - a pointer to an xml object
 *  - a VectorMap to handle links to DS variables (no copy!!!). Filled in during initialize.
 *
