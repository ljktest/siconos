 * \f]
 *
 * \f[
 * \dot y = \nabla^\top_q h(q,z) \dot q

 *
 * with
 *
 * \f[
 * H^\top(q,z) = \nabla_q h(q,z)
 * \f]
 *
 * is the pure Lagrangian setting.
 *
 *  y (or its discrete approximation) is stored in y[0]
 * \f$ \dot y \f$ (or its discrete approximation) is  stored in y[1]
 *  higher level y[i] can be used for storing higher levels of derivatives.
 *
 * Jacobians and h are connected to plug-in functions.\n
 * The plugin function to compute h(q,z) needs the following parameters:\n
 * --> sizeQ: size of q = sum of the sizes of all the DynamicalSystems involved in the interaction\n
 * --> q : pointer to the first element of q \n
 * --> sizeY : size of vector y (ie of the interaction) \n
 * --> [in,out] y : pointer to the first element of y \n
 * --> sizeZ : size of vector z \n
 * --> [in,out] z: pointer to z vector(s) from DS. \n
 * Its signature must be "void plugin(unsigned int, double*, unsigned int, double*, unsigned int, double*)"\n\n
 * The plugin function to compute G0(q,z), gradient of h according to q, needs the following parameters: \n
 *--> sizeQ: size of q = sum of the sizes of all the DynamicalSystems involved in the interaction  \n
 *--> q : pointer to the first element of q  \n
 *--> sizeY : size of vector y (ie of the intercation) \n
 *--> [in,out] H : pointer to the first element of H (sizeY X sizeDS matrix)\n
