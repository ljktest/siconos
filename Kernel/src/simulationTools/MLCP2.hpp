/** Formalization and Resolution of a Mixed Linear Complementarity Problem (MLCP)
 *
 *  \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
 *  \version 3.0.0.
 *  \date (Creation) Apr 26, 2004
 *
 * \section MLCPintro Aim of the MLCP class
 *
 * This class is devoted to the formalization and the resolution of the
 * Mixed Linear Complementarity Problem (MLCP) defined by :
 *  * \f[
 * 0 =  Au + Cv + a
 * \f]
 * \f[
 * z =  Du + Bv + b
 * \f]
 * \f[
 * v \geq 0, z \geq 0,  z^{T} v =0
 * \f]
 * where
 *    - \f$ u \in R^{n} \f$ \f$ v \in R^{m} \f$  and \f$z \in R^{m} \f$ are the unknowns,
 *    - \f$ a \in R^{n} \f$ and \f$ b \in R^{m} \f$
 *    - \f$ A \in R^{n \times n } \f$
 *    - \f$ B \in R^{m \times m } \f$
 *    - \f$ C \in R^{n \times m } \f$
 *    - \f$ D \in R^{m \times n } \f$
 *
 *  The MLCP main components are:
 *  - a problem (variables A,B,C,D,a,b and size of the problem), which directly corresponds to the MixedLinearComplementarityProblem structure of Numerics
 *  - the unknowns u,v and z
 *
 *  A MLCP is connected to a simulation that handles a NonSmoothDynamicalSystem and its Topology. \n
 *  IndexSets from simulation are used to know which constraints (UnitaryRelation) are active or not. \n
 *
 * \b Construction:
 *   - XML reading (inputs = xml node with tag "OneStepNSProblem" and a SP::Simulation)
 *   - Constructor from data (inputs = Simulations*, id, NumericsSolverName) - The solver is optional.
 * Main functions:
 *
 * \b Main functions:
 *  - formalization of the problem: computes A,B,C,D,a,b using the set of "active" UnitaryRelations from the simulation and \n
 *  the block-matrices saved in the field blocks.\n
 *  Functions: initialize(), computeBlock(), preCompute()
 *  - solving of the problem: function compute(), used to call solvers from Numerics through \n
 * the mlcp_driver() interface of Numerics.
 *  - post-treatment of data: set values of y/lambda variables of the active UR (ie Interactions) using \n
 *  ouput results from the solver (u,v,z); function postCompute().
