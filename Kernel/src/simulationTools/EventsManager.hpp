/** Tools to handle a set of Events for the Simulation

   \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
   \version 3.6.0.
   \date (Creation) December 22, 2012

   The EventsManager handles a set of events (from user time-discretisation, sensors, non-smooth ...),
   and is supposed to provide to the simulation the values of "current" and "next" events to define
   the time-integration interval.

   Events:
   - currentEvent: starting time for integration. Initialized with t0 of the simulation time-discretisation.
   - ETD: corresponds to the instant t[k+1] of the Simulation (user) TimeDiscretisation.
   - ENonSmooth: for EventDriven simulation only. Present only if one or more non-smooth events have been
   detected between currentEvent and the next event.
   - Sensor or Actuators Events. To each Sensor or Actuator declared in the ControlManager, corresponds
   an Event in the manager. When this event is processed, its time value is increased to next instant
   in the time-discretisation of the sensor/actuator.

   Examples:
   - for a TimeStepping, with one Sensor, the EventsManager looks like:\n
   {currentEvent(tk), ESensor(tsensor), ETD(tk+1)}
   - for an EventDriven, with one actuator, an non-smooth event detected at time tns: \n
   {currentEvent(tk), EActuator(tact), ENonSmooth(tns), ETD(tk+1)}.

   After each process, the time values of each event are updated and nextEvent points to the first event after currentEvent.

   \section EMMfunc Main functions
   - initialize(): process all events which have the same time as currentEvent
   - processEvents(): process all events simultaneous to nextEvent, increment them to next step, update index sets,
   increment currentEvent.
