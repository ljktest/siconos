/** A time discretisation scheme

    \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
    \version 3.0.0.
    \date (Creation) Apr 26, 2004

    A TimeDiscretisation object is used to discretized a given time interval. \n
    TimeDiscretisation are used:
    - in the simulation, as a user-input to discretized [t0,T]
    - in Sensor and Actuator, to define the set of time instants where the sensor or actuator
    must operate.

    A TimeDiscretisation is defined with a starting time (t0), a time step size (h, non necessarily constant),
    the number of the current time step (k). \n
    The time instant values are saved in a vector tk. Depending on the way of construction of the TimeDiscretisation,
    all or only current and next times are saved in tk. The difference is just a question of saving memory. \n

    Note that the TimeDiscretisation is not linked to the Model. It's up to the user to check that the way he builds his time-discretisation fits with the t0 and T given in the model.

    \section tdMfunc Main functions:
    - setCurrentTimeStep(), to set current h. This value will be used for all future time steps, until next change.
    - increment(), shift to next time step (increment k, and shift t[k] and t[k+1])
    - getCurrentTime(), return t[k]

    \section tdBuild Construction

    - input = the complete vector tk. This defines t0, T, number of time steps and time step size
    (which is not necessarily constant). In this case, the whole vector is saved in the memory.
    - inputs = number of time steps, t0 and T.
    size h is computed with t0,T and nSteps. Only two values are saved: t[k] and t[k+1] = t[k] + h.
    h can be changed at any time.
    - inputs = h and t0. Only two values are saved: t[k] and t[k+1] = t[k] + h.
    h can be changed at any time.
    - inputs = t0 and h.  Only two values are saved: t[k] and t[k+1] = t[k] + h.
    h can be changed at any time.
