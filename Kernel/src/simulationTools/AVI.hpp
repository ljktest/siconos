  \section AVIintro Aim of the AVI class
 
  This class is devoted to the formalization and the resolution of
  Affine variational Inequalities (AVI): given a polytopic set \f$P\f$ and \f$q\in R^p\f$,
  \f[
  \text{find z}\in P\text{such that for all x}\in P\quad \langle x-z, Mz+q\rangle \geq 0.
  \f]
  \todo : add "recover" function to start from old values of z and w.
