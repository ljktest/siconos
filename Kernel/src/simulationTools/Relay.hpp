/** Formalization and Resolution of a Linear Complementarity Problem (Relay)
 
   \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
   \version 3.0.0.
   \date (Creation) Apr 26, 2004
 
  \section Relayintro Aim of the Relay class
 
  This class is devoted to the formalization and the resolution of the
  Relay NonSmooth problems.
  \f[
  w =  q + M z
  \f]
  \f[
  w \geq 0, z \geq 0,  z^{T} w =0
  \f]
  where
     - \f$ w \in R^{n} \f$  and \f$z \in R^{n} \f$ are the unknowns,
     - \f$ M \in R^{n \times n } \f$  and \f$q \in R^{n} \f$
      
  \todo : add "recover" function to start from old values of z and w.
  \todo : review this introduction ...
