/** Formalization and Resolution of a Linear Complementarity Problem (Equality)

 *  \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
 *  \version 3.0.0.
 *  \date (Creation) Apr 26, 2004
 *
 * \section Equalityintro Aim of the Equality class
 *
 * This class is devoted to the formalization and the resolution of the
 * Linear system (Equality) defined by :
 *  \f[
 * 0 = w =  q + M z
 * \f]
 * where
 *    - \f$ w \in R^{n} \f$  and \f$z \in R^{n} \f$ are the unknowns,
 *    - \f$ M \in R^{n \times n } \f$  and \f$q \in R^{n} \f$
 *
 *  The Equality main components are:
 *  - a problem (variables M,q and size of the problem), which directly corresponds to the LinearComplementarityProblem structure of Numerics
 *  - the unknowns z and w
 *
 *  A Equality is connected to a simulation that handles a NonSmoothDynamicalSystem and its Topology. \n
 *  IndexSets from simulation are used to know which constraints (Interaction) are active or not. \n
 *
 * \b Construction:
 *   - XML reading (inputs = xml node with tag "OneStepNSProblem" and a SP::Simulation)
 *   - Constructor from data (inputs = Simulations*, id, SP::NonSmoothSolver) - The solver is optional.
 * Main functions:
 *
 * \b Main functions:
 *  - formalization of the problem: computes M,q using the set of "active" Interactions from the simulation and \n
 *  the interactionBlock-matrices saved in the field interactionBlocks.\n
