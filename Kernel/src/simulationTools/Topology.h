/**  This class describes the topology of the non-smooth dynamical

 *  Relative Degrees.
 *
 *  \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
 *  \version 3.0.0.
 *  \date (Creation) July 20, 2005
 *
 *  Topology is built in NSDS constructors but initialized in
 *  Simulation->initialize(), ie when all Interactions have been
 *  clearly defined.
 *
 * Note that indexSet0 holds all the possible relations (declared by
 * user) not only those which are "actives".
 *
 * Construction consists in:
 *    - link with the NSDS that owns the topology.
 *
 * Initialization consists in:
 *    - scan of all the interactions of the NSDS
 *    - initialization of each interaction
 *    - insertion of the relations of all the Interaction into indexSet0
 *    - computation of all relative degrees
 *
 * Insertion of an Interaction into the set indexSet0:
 * addInteractionInIndexSet(SP::Interaction inter) for each relation
 * of the interaction, it creates a new UnitaryRelation and inserts it
 * into indexSet0 It also counts the total number of "constraints" in
 * the system.
 *
 * Relative degrees computation: at the time, depends only on the
 * non-smooth law type of each UnitaryRelation.  Degrees are saved in
 * a map that links each UnitaryRelation to an int, its relative
 * degree.
