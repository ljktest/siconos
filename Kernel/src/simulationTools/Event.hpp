/** Abstract class that represents generic time events.

 *  \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
 *  \version 3.0.0.
 *  \date (Creation) February 21, 2006
 *
 *  This base class simply records the time at which the event will take place. A pure virtual function named process
 *  will be invoked to execute the event.
 *  The time is represented with a mpz_t, from gmp library. See http://gmplib.org.
 *
 * Derived classes:
 * - TimeDiscretisationEvent: events that corresponds to user-defined time-discretisation points
 * - NonSmoothEvent: specific events, detected during simulation, when constraints are violated (thanks to roots-finding algorithm)
 * - SensorEvent: event dedicated to data capture through user-defined sensors.
 *
 *
 * Existing types of events:
 *  0 -> undef
 *  1 -> TimeDiscretisation
*  2 -> NonSmooth
*  3 -> Actuator
*  4 -> Sensor
