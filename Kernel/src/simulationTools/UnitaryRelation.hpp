/** Interface to single relations from Interactions
 *
 *  \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
 *  \version 3.0.0.
 *  \date (Creation) June 06, 2006
 *
 * Remind that each Interaction is composed with one (pointer to)
 * relation and a non smooth law (size nsLawSize). The number of
 * relations is sizeOfInteraction/nsLawSize. A UnitaryRelation is one
 * of the relations of the Interaction. Actually, this class only
 * provides an interface to handle single relations, this for
 * IndexSets used in Topology.  Each UnitaryRelation has a pointer to
 * its "mother" Interaction and methods to compute y, lambda and so
 * on.
 *
 * - UnitaryBlocks computation: in OneStepNSProblem, some
 * operators/matrices are required to compute the unitaryBlocks
 * matrices (used for example for the assembly of Mlcp matrix).  In
 * the present class, three methods are available to get the required
 * unitaryBlocks: getLeftUnitaryBlockForDS, getRightUnitaryBlockForDS
 * and getExtraUnitaryBlock, with the general model for unitaryBlock
 * computation:
 *
 * unitaryBlock = getExtraUnitaryBlock  +  getLeftUnitaryBlockForDS * W * getRightUnitaryBlockForDS
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *   => LinearTIR, unitaryBlock = D + h*theta*C*W*B (D != NULL only
 *      for unitaryBlocks on the diagonal of the full-assembled
 *      matrix) and thus getExtraUnitaryBlock = D,
 *      getLeftUnitaryBlockForDS = C, getRightUnitaryBlockForDS = B.
 *
 *   => Lagrangian, unitaryBlock = G* W* transpose(G) (G=H for
 *      xslagrangian linear) ie getExtraUnitaryBlock = NULL,
 *      getLeftUnitaryBlockForDS = getRightUnitaryBlockForDS = G
 *      (transpose is done using matMultTranspose)
 *
 * Moreover, for, G, B, etc ... we only get the part corresponding to
 * a specific DynamicalSystem (which belongs to the UnitaryRelation)
