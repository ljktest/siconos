/**  Moreau Time-Integrator for Dynamical Systems
 *
 *  \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
 *  \version 3.0.0.
 *  \date (Creation) Apr 26, 2004
 *
 * See User's guide, \ref docSimuMoreauTS for details.
 *
 * Moreau class is used to define some time-integrators methods for a list of dynamical systems.
 * Each DynamicalSystem is associated to a SiconosMatrix, named "W", and a double, "theta", through two
 * STL maps:
 * - WMap, with WMap[ds] = a pointer to a SiconosMatrix
 * - thetaMap, thetaMap[ds] = a double
 * ds being a SP::DynamicalSystem
 *
 * W matrices are initialized and computed in initW and computeW. Depending on the DS type, they
 * may depend on time and DS state (x).
 *
 * Main functions:
 *
 * - computeFreeState(): computes Ffree (or vfree), dynamical systems state without taking non-smooth part into account \n
 * - updateState():
 *
