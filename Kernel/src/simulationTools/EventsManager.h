 *     - An event can not be modified (but removed!) => no setEvent(Event) function
 *     - All Events are created inside this class
 *       That means user can not create an Event and then insert it. He is forced to
 *       scheduleEvent method.
 *     - Tick must be set at construction, and can not be change after.
