   Abstract class, interface to user-defined sensors.

   A Sensor is dedicated to data capture. It gives an interface for
   User who can implement its own Sensor to clearly define which data
   he needs to save.

   A Sensor handles a TimeDiscretisation, which defines the set of all
   instants where the sensor must operate \n (i.e. each times where
   capture() function will be called). An Event, inserted into the
   EventsManager of the Simulation, is linked to this
   TimeDiscretisation.

   Moreover, a Sensor is identified thanks to an id and a type (a
   number associated to the derived class type indeed).

   \section BSensor Construction

   To build a Sensor it is necessary to use the factory. Inputs are a
   number which identify the derived class type and a
   TimeDiscretisation:

   \code

   // Get the registry
   SensorFactory::Registry& regSensor(SensorFactory::Registry::get()) ;
   // Build a Sensor of type "myType" with t as a TimeDiscretisation.
   regSensor.instantiate(myType, t);

   \endcode

   The best way is to use the controlManager:
   \code
   // cm a ControlManager
   cm->addSensor(myType,t);
   // or if cm has already been initialized:
   cm->addAndRecordSensor(myType,t)
   \endcode


   The data are saved in a DataSet object named data, a map which
   associate to each Event another map.  This second map links a
   string, used to identify the data, and a SiconosVector.  As an
   example consider the case where you need to save the state vector x
   of a DynamicalSystem, then you can define a Data object, with
   "myDS_X" as an id and yourDS->x() as the SiconosVector. For
   myEvent being an Event where you need to save data, you get:
   (data[myEvent])["myDS_X] =
   model->nonSmoothDynamicalSystem()->dynamicalSystem()->x()

   See \ref UMSiconosControl for details on how to define its own Sensor.
