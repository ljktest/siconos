/** ControlManager Class: tools to control a Model (Sensors, Actuators ...)

    \author SICONOS Development Team - copyright INRIA
    \version 3.0.0.
    \date (Creation) February 08, 2007

    This class is used to handle all the sensors and actuators declared by the user and to
    schedule them into the simulation.

    A ControlManager has:
    - a list of sensors
    - a list of actuators
    - a link to an existing model

    The usual way to define control over a system is as follows:
    - declare a ControlManager and associate it with a Model
    - add some sensors and actuators into the ControlManager
    - initialize the ControlManager (which will result in the recording of all actuators and sensors into the
    list of events processed during the simulation)
    - optionally add some new sensor/actuator at any time but with a specific function: addAndRecord(...).
    A call to this function results in the creation of a Sensor/Actuator and in the insertion of the corresponding event
    into the simulation eventsManager.
