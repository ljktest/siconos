To install properly boost-bindings from the sources distributed with siconos:

./configure --prefix=INSTALLPATH

usually INSTALLPATH = /usr/include or /usr/local/include
or the place where you have installed boost

Thus locate rep boost/numeric and set INSTALLPATH= the place where boost/numeric is.

(bindings are installed in INSTALLPATH/boost/numeric/bindings)

Else, to get directly a new version, see:
