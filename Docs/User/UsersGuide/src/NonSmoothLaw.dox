\b What \b is \b a \b Non-Smooth \b Law? \n

A non-smooth law is an object used to define the behavior of the systems involved in an Interaction, when a non-smooth event occurs. \n
For example, in the case of an impact, a Newton impact law will link the pre and post velocities at impact in something like "post-velocity = -e X pre-velocity".

\b Building \b a \b NonSmooth \b Law ?\n

Each non-smooth law is characterized by a type (more or less the name of its class), a size, plus some specific variables depending on its type.\n
The top abstract class NonSmoothLaw is only a generic interface for the specific laws defined below.

\b Available \b classes: NonSmoothLaw, ComplementarityConditionNSL, NewtonImpactNSL, NewtonImpactFrictionNSL, RelayNSL.

\section docNSLNI Newton Impact
nsLawSize: 1.\n
parameter: \e e, the Newton normal coefficient of restitution.

\section docNSLNIF Newton Impact-Friction
nsLawSize: 2 or 3 (2 or 3 dimensional friction).\n
parameters: en, et (Newton impact normal and tangential coefficients) and mu, friction coefficient.\n

Newton Impact Law plus Coulomb Friction. \n
In this case, y components are in the following order:\n
first relation, normal part\n
first relation, tangential part\n
...\n
relation n, normal part \n
relation n, tangential part\n
and so on ...\n

Note also that usually only normal part definition is required for y[0].
