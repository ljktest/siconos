/*! \page start_NSP Introduction: How to describe a Non Smooth Problem with Siconos

\section start_modelinPrinciple Modeling Principle

A Non Smooth Dynamical System is mainly a set of Dynamical Systems that may interact together, through what we call some Non Smooth Interactions. 

The figure below summarizes the modeling process inside Siconos:

Thus, first step in the process consists in defining some <b> Dynamical Systems</b>, namely some systems of ordinary differential equations. 
Then, we define a <b> Non Smooth Law</b> that links local variables (unilateral constraints). Finally some \b Relations between the local variables and the global coordinates of the Dynamical System(s) are written. \n
The union of relations and the corresponding non smooth law is what we call an \b Interaction, associated with one or more DynamicalSystems. 

For details on :
- DynamicalSystems see \ref dsInSiconos. \n
- Interactions, Relations and Non Smooth Laws see \ref doc_Interactions

As a simple example, consider the classical case of a ball bouncing on the floor: \ref EMBouncingBall.

\section start_writingProcess Writing Process

Any Siconos input file is composed of the following steps:

-# define some DynamicalSystems
-# define some Interactions, and for each Interaction: 
  - define Relation
  - define NonSmoothLaw
-# build a NonSmoothDynamicalSystem: all DynamicalSystems + all Interactions
-# build a Model that holds the NonSmoothDynamicalSystem.
-# define a Simulation: the way the behavior of the NonSmoothDynamicalSystem will be computed
  - define a TimeDiscretisation
  - choose a strategy: TimeStepping or EventDriven
  - define some integrators for the DynamicalSystems (OneStepIntegrator)
  - define a way to formalize and solve the possible non smooth problems (formulation + solver, the OneStepNSProblem)
-# associate the Simulation to the Model
-# lead the Simulation (time loop)
