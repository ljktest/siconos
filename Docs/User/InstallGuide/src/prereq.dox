\section req_libs Required libraries

\subsection atlas 1 - ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software). 

On most Linuxes this package is available as pre-compiled binary under the name atlas. You also need atlas-devel to include some required header files. \n
Atlas usually comes with \b Blas (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) and \b Lapack (Linear Algebra PACKage). 

\e Examples: \n

\b Fedora: 
\verbatim
yum install atlas atlas-devel 
\endverbatim
\b Debian
\verbatim
apt-get install atlas atlas-devel
\endverbatim

\subsection xml 2 - libxml2
The XML C parser and toolkit. Required for XML file reading and writing.

Usually available as rpm or pre-compiled binaries.

\subsection boost 3 - Boost
Boost provides a lot of useful C++ binaries, especially \b Ublas, a C++ template class library that provides BLAS level 1, 2, 3 functionality for dense, packed and sparse matrices. 

Ublas is used in Siconos for matrices and vectors definition and implementation.

Install:

-# Download Boost at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586
-# Download bjam. The recommended way to get Boost.Jam if you are using a Boost distribution is to  download a pre-built executable from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=72941.
-# Type in the Boost directory: /the/path/of/BOOST-JAM/bjam install (as root)
