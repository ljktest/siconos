\section IG_installsources Installing from Sources.

\subsection compile_linux Linux/Unix

First download all the required packages (.tgz) as explained in \ref IG_download section.\n
Then uncompressed the downloaded archives:
\verbatim 
tar -zxvf siconos-XXXX.tgz
\endverbatim

XXXX being Numerics, Kernel or Front-End package name. \n

For compilation of each package, run the following commands in Numerics/Kernel/FrontEnd directories:

<em> Warning: you may need to be connected as root for "make install", depending on the targeted location. </em>

\verbatim
 ./configure 
  make
  make install
\endverbatim

Take care to the resulting messages after "configure" call; if some external libraries are missing or \n
with a too old version it may fail. 

Type <tt>./configure --help</tt> to see more information on the available options.

The default installation path is /usr/local but you can choose a local one at configure:\n
\verbatim
./configure --prefix=/your/install/path 
\endverbatim

\b Warning: if the "configure" file is not in the directory, you may need to run "./autogen.sh" first, to generate it.

To run tests: 
\verbatim
  make check
\endverbatim

To generate Doxygen documentation:
\verbatim
make doc
\endverbatim

The resulting doc (html) is saved in ../GeneratedDocs/XXX, XXX being Kernel or Numerics.
