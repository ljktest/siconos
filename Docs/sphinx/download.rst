If you are a developer of the platform, you can use the git revision control and source code management system to get the software.
First you need to log in on Gforge, join the Siconos project, add your ssh-key and follow the instructions at https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=9 .

Some useful commands:

* git pull --rebase: bring your working copy "up-to-date" with the Gforge repository.
* git commit file1 file2: commit the new version of your file(s) to your local repository.
* git status: show you the state of any item in your working copy
  (option -uno: list only the files under version control)
* git add filename: filename (file or directory) will now be under version control (after the next commit).
* git rm name: delete name (next commit)
* git diff: see your current changes (w.r.t. the lastest commit on your repo) in diff form.
* git push: propagate your changes to the main repository on Gforge.
* git *item* --help: help on item
