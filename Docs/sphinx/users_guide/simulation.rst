A "simulation" is the description of how a nonsmooth dynamical system will be computed in Siconos.
At the time, two strategies are available:

* time-stepping schemes
* event-driven schemes
 
The key points are:

* the time discretisation
* the time integration of dynamical systems
* the formulation and resolution of one or more nonsmooth problems
