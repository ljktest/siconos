The Siconos Platform is a scientific computing software dedicated to
the modeling, simulation, control and analysis of <b>Non Smooth
Dynamical Systems (NSDS)</b>. Especially, the following classes of
NSDS are addressed:

<ul>
  <li> Mechanical systems with contact, impact and friction</li>
  <li> Electrical circuits with ideal and piecewise linear components</li>
  <li> Differential inclusions and Complementarity systems</li>
</ul>
