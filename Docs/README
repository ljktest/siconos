=== Web pages generation  (siconos.gforge.inria.fr) ===

Directories in: (BASE = siconos/trunk/)

- Siconos Home Page -> BASE/Docs/HomePage

- Getting Started With Siconos -> BASE/Docs/Users/GettingStarted

- Installation Guide -> BASE/Docs/Users/SiconosInstall

The corresponding css is in BASE/css directory.
All figures must be in BASE/Docs/figures (with possibly subdirectories)

Process:
In each of the directories above, launch doxywizard, load the .cfg file 
which is in the related config directory, and start doc generation. 

This will result in html pages generation in BASE/htdocs.

- BASE/GeneratedDocs/index.html: Siconos Home Page
- BASE/GeneratedDocs/GettingStarted/index.html: Getting Started With Siconos main page
- BASE/GeneratedDocs/SiconosInstallindex.html: Installation Guide main page

In the same way, run doxywizard in Numerics and Kernel for sources documentation.
Results:
- BASE/GeneratedDocs/Kernel/index.html: for Kernel API documentation.
- BASE/GeneratedDocs/Numerics/index.html: for Numerics API documentation.
The css is in config/css. 

Or for Examples Manual:
- BASE/GeneratedDocs/Samples/index.html: Siconos Examples Manual
The css is in config/css, the main page in src/

The latex corresponding files are in BASE/.../latex directory. Run make to generate a pdf document (refMan.pdf).
