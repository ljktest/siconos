Getting Started with Siconos
============================

This manual aims at giving user a short overview of the software functionnalities.
It is also supposed to provide some guidelines on how to build its own simulation.
However, this manual does not give a full description of all the Siconos classes, functions etc.
For this, you need to check directly :ref:`siconos_api_reference` or :ref:`siconos_python_reference`, depending on the interface you choose.

For more details on specific topics see :ref:`siconos_users_guide`.
