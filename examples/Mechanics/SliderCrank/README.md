Slider Crank
============

This is an example of a simple multibody system, developed in [4] and shown in the figure below:

![image](slider_crank.*)

All variables names and parameters values are those from the paper cited above.

In siconos, this example is simulated in several different ways :

-  SliderCrankMoreauJeanOSI.cpp: simulation with the standard Moreau--Jean one-step integrator
-  SliderCrankD1MinusLinear.cpp: simulation with the Time discontinuous Galerkin integrator D1 minus written at the acceleration level [2]
-  SliderCrankD1MinusLinearVelocityLevel.cpp: simulation with the Time discontinuous Galerkin integrator D1 minus written at the velocity level [3]
-  SliderCrankMoreauJeanCombinedProjectionOSI.cpp: simulation with the Moreau--Jean one-step integrator with the combined projection algorithm for the projection at the position [1]
-  SliderCrankMoreauJeanDirectProjectionOSI.cpp: simulation with the Moreau--Jean one-step integrator with the direct projection algorithm for the projection at the position [1]

Usage
-----

    siconos example_name.cpp

and to plot the results, you can use for example:

    gnuplot -p result.gp

This must lead to Fig 11 (d) of the paper
