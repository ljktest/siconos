/*! \page RelaySolvers Relay Problems Solvers

This page gives an overview of the available solvers for relay problems and their required parameters.

For each solver, the input argument are:
- a RelayProblem
- the unknowns (z,w)
- info, the termination value (0: convergence, >0 problem which depends on the solver)
- a SolverOptions structure, which handles iparam and dparam

\section relayENUM Enumerative solver
The relay problem is reformulated as a LCP and solved with the enumerative solver

 function: relay_enum()\n
   parameters:
  - dparam[0] (in): tolerance
  - iparam[0] (in) : search for multiple solutions if 1
  - iparam[1] (out) : key of the solution
  - iparam[3] (in) :  starting key values (seed)
  - iparam[4] (in) :  use DGELS (1) or DGESV (0).

\section relayPATH PATH solver
The relay problem is reformulated as a LCP and solved with the PATH solver

 function: relay_path()\n
- dparam[0] (in): tolerance

\section relayLEMKE Lemke solver
The relay problem is reformulated as a LCP and solved with Lemke's method

 function: relay_lexicolemke()\n
 parameters:
- iparam[0] (in): maximum number of iterations allowed
- iparam[1] (out): number of iterations processed

\section relayAVI_CaoFerris CaoFerris solver
The relay problem is reformulated as an AVI and solved with the solver proposed by Cao and Ferris

 function: relay_avi_caoferris()\n
 parameters:
- iparam[0] (in): maximum number of iterations allowed
- iparam[1] (out): number of iterations processed
