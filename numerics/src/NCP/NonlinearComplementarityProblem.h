  \section ncpIntro  Problem Statement
  Given a sufficiently smooth function \f${F}\colon {{\mathrm{I\!R}}}^{n}  \to {{\mathrm{I\!R}}}^{n}\f$
  The Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP) is to find two vectors \f$(z,w \in {{\mathrm{I\!R}}}^{n})\f$ such that:
  \f{align*}{
  w &= F(z) \\
  0 &\le w \perp z \ge 0
  \f}

  \section ncpSolversList Available solvers:
  - ncp_FBLSA(), nonsmooth Newton method based on Fisher-Burmeister function with a line search.
  - ncp_pathsearch(), a solver based on a path search method
