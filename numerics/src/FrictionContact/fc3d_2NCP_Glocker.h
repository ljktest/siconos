/*!\file fc3d_2NCP_Glocker.h
  \brief interface to functions used to write the Friction-Contact 3D problem
  as a NCP, using Glocker formulation.

  The idea is to write the Friction Contact problem as a NCP:
  The input problem looks like:
  \f[
  velocity = M.reaction +q
  \f]
  velocity, reaction (the unknowns) and q are vectors of size n. M is a nXn matrix.

  and is formulate as:
  Find \f$reaction_G \in \mathcal{R}^5\f$ such that:\n\n
  \f$
  0 \le F_G(reaction_G) \perp reaction_G \ge 0 \\
  \f$
  with
  \f$ F_G(reaction_G) = M_G.reaction_G + g(reaction_G) + q_G \f$
  index \f$ G \f$ stands for "Glocker" in all related operators.

  The relations between \$_G\$ operators and input Friction-Contact problem, plus all other details, are given in:
  Acary, V. and B. Brogliato (2008). Numerical Methods for Nonsmooth Dynamical Systems: Applications
