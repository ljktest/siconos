Description: Siconos/Kernel, is dedicated to the modeling and the simulation of NSDS
 The present package, Siconos/Kernel, is dedicated to the modeling and
 the simulation of NSDS, with high level description and numerical
 solving strategies.  It relies on Siconos/Numerics which provides
 low-level algorithms to compute basic well-identified problems.
