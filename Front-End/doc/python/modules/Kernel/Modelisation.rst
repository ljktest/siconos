Usage : example of the modelisation of a bouncing ball
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ball bouncing on the ground may be defined as a linear lagrangian time
invariant dynamical system with one degree of freedom. 

.. math::

      M \ddot q = F_{ext} + p


where :
 - :math:`q` is the state vector. :math:`q \in \mathbb{R}^{1}`. The only coordinate
   corresponds to the height of the center of the ball.
 - :math:`M` is the time invariant mass matrix. :math:`M` is a 1 x 1 matrix.
 - :math:`F_{ext}` contains the external forces. Here the gravity is applied.
 - :math:`p` is the reaction force due to the nonsmooth interaction with the floor.

We first import the needed classes from `Siconos.Kernel` module:

 - `LagrangianLinearTIDS`, for a Linear Lagrangian Time Invariant Dynamical System object.
 - `LagrangianLinearTIR`, for a Linear Lagrangian Time Invariant Relation object.
 - `NewtonImpactNSL`, for a Newton Impact NonSmooth Law object.
 - `Interaction`, to build an object that glues the relation and the nonsmooth law.
 - `Model`, to build an object that gathers all the modeling and simulation objects.

.. testcode::

  from Siconos.Kernel import \
      LagrangianLinearTIDS, LagrangianLinearTIR, NewtonImpactNSL, \
      Interaction, Model

To build a `LagrangianLinearTIDS` object, we have to give an initial
position vector, an initial velocity vector and the constant mass
matrix of the object.

The position and velocity are both vectors of size 1. The mass
matrix is defined as a 1 x 1 matrix.

.. testcode::
  
  position = [1]    # initial position vector
  velocity = [0]    # initial velocity vector
  mass = 1          # mass of the ball
  M = [[mass]]      # mass matrix 
  
  ball = LagrangianLinearTIDS(position, velocity, M)

The gravity is expressed in the coordinates choosen for the ball. It is then
applied as a constant external force.

.. testcode::

  g = 9.81  
  weight = [- mass * g]    # a vector of size 1
  ball.setFExtPtr(weight)  # apply gravity

The ball is constrained to lie above the floor. The relation between
the state space and the constraint space is a linear mapping :math:`y
= C * q` where :math:`y` denotes the constraint vector and :math:`q`
denotes the state vector. :math:`C` is a 1 x 1 matrix: 
:math:`C = \{1\}`

We build an object for this relation with the `LagrangianLinearTIR` class:

.. testcode::

  C = [[1]]           
  relation = LagrangianLinearTIR(C)

The "above floor" constraint is unilateral and defined by :math:`y
> 0` and a relation between velocities before and after impact. Let
:math:`t^{-}` denotes the time instant before impact and :math:`t^{+}` denotes
time instant after impact. Then if we add to the unilateral constraint a linear
relation between the velocities :math:`\dot y(t^{+}) = e * \dot
y(t^{-})`, we define a Newton impact nonsmooth law:

.. testcode::

  e = 0.9
  nslaw = NewtonImpactNSL(e)

The relation and the nonsmooth law are tied together in an `Interaction`
object:

.. testcode::

  inter = Interaction(nslaw,    
                      relation) 

We finally build a `Model` object to gather the dynamical sytems we
have defined (here just the ball) and link the interactions to them.

.. testcode::

  # the first parameter is the start time
  # the second parameter is the end time
  bouncingBall = Model(0, 10)

  # add the ball to the model's non smooth dynamical system
  bouncingBall.nonSmoothDynamicalSystem().insertDynamicalSystem(ball)

  # link the interaction and the dynamical system
  bouncingBall.nonSmoothDynamicalSystem().link(inter, ball)
