 Quick installation notes for Siconos Control
----------------------------------------------

A complete Installation Guide is available at
siconos.gforge.inria.fr/SiconosInstall/index.html.

The installation of Siconos Kernel is required.

---++ Required external libraries

   * Boost (version >=1.41). Only headers are needed

---++ Optional external libraries (advised for developers)

   * cppunit (may be avoided with -DWITH_TESTING=False)

---++ Getting the sources

   * Through the git server (access required)
       git clone git+ssh://user@scm.gforge.inria.fr/gitroot/siconos/siconos.git
       for more explanation see http://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=9
   * Download the source packages on the Gforge


---++ BUILD & INSTALL with cmake

The command `cmake' is needed (http://www.cmake.org/). The cmake
version must be >= 2.8.

The compilation is done out of the source directory:

   * create a build directory <build>
   * cd <build>
   * cmake <path of the source directory> [CMAKE OPTIONS]
   * make [MAKE OPTIONS]
   * make test (if -DWITH_TESTING=ON is in CMAKE OPTIONS)
   * make install

Some CMAKE OPTIONS that may be usefull:

   * to find include headers in specific directories :
     -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=<DIR>

     use a semicolon to separate directories (and not a colon!!):
     -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH="<DIR1>;<DIR2>;.."


   * to find libraries in specific directories :
     -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=<DIR> 

     for several directories, see above.


   * to build a debug library (compilation with -g) :
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

   * to build an optimized library (-O3 -DNDEBUG) (this is the
     default) : 
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

   * to include the build of the tests suites and enable a make test
     target (cppunit is needed)
     -DWITH_TESTING=ON

   * to build the documentation
     -DWITH_DOCUMENTATION=TRUE 
     the documentation is generated under GeneratedDocs at the level
     of the build directory

   * to build the documentation some where
     -DWITH_DOCUMENTATION=TRUE -DDOXYGEN_OUTPUT=/some/where
     (you may have to create the directory /some/where/Tags)

   * to build with Bullet collision detection library
     -DWITH_BULLET=TRUE 
     if bullet was built in double precision
     -DBULLET_USE_DOUBLE_PRECISION=TRUE

   * to print cmake state : -DPRINT_ENV=1

   * to print a cmake variable : -DPRINT_VAR=VAR_NAME

Some MAKE OPTIONS that may be usefull:
   * to see make command as executed : VERBOSE=1

---+++ Is the installation of the Control OK ?

   * You can try to run : 

   cd /path/to/your/source/code/Examples/Control/PID ; siconos PID.cpp
