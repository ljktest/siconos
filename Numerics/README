  README File for Siconos Numerics
------------------------------------

This project belongs to the European project SICONOS, dedicated to the modeling, the control the analysis and the simulation of the so-called 
``Non Smooth Dynamical system'' NSDS. More details on this European project can be found on the website of the Project http://siconos.inrialpes.fr.

The present package, Siconos/Numerics provides low-level algorithms to compute basic well-identified problems.

More details are available on software documentation pages, Doc/Devel directory of the current distribution, in "design" chapter,
or on http://siconos.gforge.inria.fr/
