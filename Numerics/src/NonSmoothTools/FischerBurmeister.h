  \brief Fischer Burmeister functions.

  A set of routines to compute the Fischer-Burmeister function and its jacobian.

  The Fischer-Burmeister function is defined as :
  \f[
  \phi(z,w) = \sqrt( z^2 + w^2) - z - w
  \f]

  This function is used to solve MLCP, MCP and NCP. The inequalities are rewritten using Fischer function with \f$ w = F(z) \f$ and solved with a semi-smooth Newton algorithm.

  For "mixed" problems (i.e. including equality constraints), the Fischer function is defined as :

  \f[ \phi_{mixed}(z,F(z)) =
  \left\lbrace \begin{array}{c}
  F_e(z) \\
  \sqrt( z^2 + F_i(z)^2) - z - F_i(z) \end{array}\right. \f]

  where index "e" stands for equalities part in F and "i" for inequalities.

  For details see the paper of Kanzow and Kleinmichel, "A New Class of Semismooth Newton-type Methods for Nonlinear
  Complementarity Problems", Computational Optimization and Applications 11, 227-251 (1998).

  The notations below are more or less those of this paper.
