/*! \page LCProblem Linear Complementarity problems (LCP)
 * \section lcpIntro The problem
 *  The Linear Complementarity problems (LCP) is defined by
 *
 *   Find \f$(z,w)\f$ such that:\n
 *   \f{equation*}{
 *   \begin{cases}
 *   M \ z + q = w \\
 *   0 \le w \perp z \ge 0 \\
 *   \end{cases}
 *   \f}
 *
 * where \f$ w, z, q\f$ are vectors of size \f$n\f$ and \f$ M \f$ is a \f$n\times n\f$ matrix.
 *
 * The notation $x \perp y$ means that $x^Ty =0$. Inequalities involving vectors
 * are understood to hold component-wise.
 *
 * From more details on theory and analysis of LCP, we refer to
 *
 * R.W. Cottle, J.S. Pang, and R.E. Stone. <i>The Linear Complementarity Problem.</i> Academic Press, Inc., Boston, MA, 1992.
 *
 *  \section lcpSolversList Available solvers

  The solvers and their parameters are described in \ref LCPSolvers . \n
  Use the generic function lcp_driver() to call one the the specific solvers listed below:

  - lcp_qp(), quadratic programm formulation
  - lcp_cpg(), CPG (Conjugated Projected Gradient) solver for LCP based on quadratic minimization.
  - lcp_pgs(), PGS is a basic Projected Gauss-Seidel solver for LCP.
  - lcp_rpgs(), Regularized Projected Gauss-Seidel, is a solver for LCP, able to handle matrices with null diagonal terms
  - lcp_psor(), Projected Succesive over relaxation solver for LCP. See cottle, Pang Stone Chap 5
  - lcp_nsqp(), quadratic programm formulation for solving an non symmetric LCP
  - lcp_latin(), (LArge Time INcrements) is a basic latin solver for LCP.
  - lcp_latin_w(), (LArge Time INcrements) is a basic latin solver with relaxation for LCP
  - lcp_lexicolemke(), direct solver for LCP based on pivoting method principle for degenerate problem.\n
  Choice of pivot variable is performed via lexicographic ordering
  Ref: "The Linear Complementarity Problem" Cottle, Pang, Stone (1992)\n
  - lcp_newton_min(), nonsmooth Newton method based on the min formulation  (or max formulation) of the LCP
  - lcp_newton_FB(), uses a nonsmooth newton method based on the Fischer-Bursmeister convex function
  - lcp_nsgs_SBM(), Gauss-Seidel solver based on a Sparse-Block storage for the matrix M of the LCP.
