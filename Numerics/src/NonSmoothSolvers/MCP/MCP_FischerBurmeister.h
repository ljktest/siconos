  \brief Fischer Burmeister function for CP

   It provides routines to compute Fischer-Burmeister function and its jacobian,
   written as a NCP-function:

    \f[
      \phi(z,F(z)) = \sqrt( z^2 + F(z)^2) - z - F(z)
    \f]

   For details see the paper of Kanzow and Kleinmichel, "A New Class of Semismooth Newton-type Methods for Nonlinear
   Complementarity Problems", Computational Optimization and Applications 11, 227-251 (1998).

   The notations below are more or less those of this paper.

   Functions:

   phi_FB(int size, double* z, double* F, double* phiVector)

   jacobianPhi_FB(int size, double* z, double* F, double* jacobianF, double* phiVector)
