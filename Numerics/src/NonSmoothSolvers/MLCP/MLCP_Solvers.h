This page gives an overview of the available solvers for MLCP and their required parameters.

For each solver, the input argument are:
- a MixedLinearComplementarity_Problem
- the unknowns (z,w)
- info, the termination value (0: convergence, >0 problem which depends on the solver)
- a Solver_Options structure, which handles iparam and dparam
