  \section mlcpIntro The problem
  Find \f$(z,w)\f$ such that:\n

  \f$
  \left\lbrace
  \begin{array}{l}
  M \ z + q = w \\
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \f$

  \f$
  z=
  \left\lbrace
  \begin{array}{c}
  u\\
  v\\
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \f$

  \f$
  w=
  \left\lbrace
  \begin{array}{c}
  w_{1}\\
  w_{2}\\
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \f$

  \f$ u, w_{1}\f$ are vectors of size n.\n
  \f$ v, w_{2}\f$ are vectors of size m.

  \f$ w_1=0\f$.\n
  \f$ 0 \le w_{2} \perp v \ge 0 \f$

  Old version (?):

  Try \f$(u,v,w)\f$ such that:\n
  \f$
  \left\lbrace
  \begin{array}{l}
  A u + Cv +a =0\\
  D u + Bv +b = w \\
  0 \le v \perp  w \ge 0\\
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \f$

  where  A is an (\f$ n \times n\f$ ) matrix, B is an (\f$ m \times m\f$ ) matrix,  C is an (\f$ n \times m\f$ ) matrix,\n
  D is an (\f$ m \times n\f$ ) matrix,    a and u is an (\f$ n \f$ ) vectors b,v and w is an (\f$ m \f$ ) vectors.

  \section mlcpSolversList Available solvers

  The solvers and their parameters are described in \ref MLCPSolvers . \n

  Use the generic function mlcp_solver(), to call one the the specific solvers listed below:
  - mlcp_pgs(), (Projected Gauss-Seidel) is a basic Projected Gauss-Seidel solver
  - mlcp_rpgs(), (Projected Gauss-Seidel) is a basic Projected Gauss-Seidel solver
  - mlcp_psor(), projected successive overrelaxation method
  - mlcp_rpsor(), regularized projected successive overrelaxation method
  - mlcp_path(), path solver
  - mlcp_enum(), enumeratif solver
  - mlcp_simplex(), solver based on the simplex algorithm
  - mlcp_direct_path(), use the last solution to find the solution. If it failed the mlcp_path is called.
  - mlcp_direct_enum(), use the last solution to find the solution. If it failed the mlcp_enum is called.
  - mlcp_direct_simplex(), use the last solution to find the solution. If it failed the mlcp_simplex is called.

  (see the functions/solvers list in MLCP_solvers.h)
