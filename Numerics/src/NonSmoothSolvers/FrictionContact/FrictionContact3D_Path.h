  \brief Typedef and functions declarations related to NCP-Path solver for 3 dimension frictional contact problems.
  \author Franck Perignon

  Each solver must have 4 functions in its interface:
  - initialize: link local static variables to the global ones (M,q,...)
  - update: link/fill the local variables corresponding to sub-blocks of the full problem, for a specific contact
  - solve: solve the local problem
  - free
