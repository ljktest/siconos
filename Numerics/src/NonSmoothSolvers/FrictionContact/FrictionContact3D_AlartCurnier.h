  \brief Typedef and functions declarations related to Alart-Curnier
  formulation for 3 dimension frictional contact problems.

  Subroutines used when the friction-contact 3D problem is written
  using Alart-Curnier formulation:

  \f{eqnarray*}
  F(reaction)=\left[\begin{array}{c}
  velocity - M.reaction - q  \\
  1/rn*[velocity_N - (velocity_N - rn*reaction_N)^+]
  1/rt*[velocity_T - proj(velocity_T - rt*reaction_T)]
  \end{array}\right]
  \f}

  where M is an n by n matrix, q an n-dimensional vector, reaction an
  n-dimensional vector and velocity an n-dimensional vector.

  We consider a "global" (ie for several contacts) problem, used to
  initialize the static global variables.  Then a "local" (ie for one
  contact => size = 3) problem is built (update function) and solved
  (solve function).

  Two different storages are available for M: dense and sparse block.
