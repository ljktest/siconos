/*!\file FrictionContact3D2NCP_Glocker.h
  interface to functions used to write the Friction-Contact 3D problem
  as a NCP, using Glocker formulation.

  The input problem looks like:
  \f[
  velocity = M.reaction +q
  \f]
  velocity, reaction (the unknowns) and q are vectors of size n. M is a nXn matrix.

  All details concerning this formulation are given in:
  Acary, V. and B. Brogliato (2008). Numerical Methods for Nonsmooth Dynamical Systems: Applications
  in Mechanics and Electronics. Vol. 35 of LNACM. Springer Verlag.
  Chapter 13, part 4.3 p 450.
