  \section lcpIntro The problem
  Find \f$(z,w)\f$ such that:\n

  \f$
  \left\lbrace
  \begin{array}{l}
  M \ z + q = w =0\\
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \f$

  \f$ w, z, q\f$ are vectors of size n and \f$ M \f$ is a nXn matrix.

  \section lcpSolversList Available solvers

  Use the generic function LinearSystem_driver() to call one the the specific solvers listed below:
