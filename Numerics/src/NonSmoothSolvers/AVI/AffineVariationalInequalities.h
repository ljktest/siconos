 * \section aviIntro The problem
 *  The Affine Variational Inequality (AVI) is defined by
 *
 *   Given \f$q\in\mathbb{R}^n\f$, \f$M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\f$ and a set \f$K\in\mathbb{R}^n\f$,
 *   find \f$z\in\mathbb{R}^n\f$ such that:
 *   \f{equation*}{(Mz+q)^T(y -z) \geq 0,\quad \text{ for all } y \in K,\f}
 *   or equivalently,
 *   \f{equation*}{- Mz + q \in \mathcal{N}_K(z)\f}
 *   where \f$\mathcal{N}_K\f$ is the normal cone to \f$K\f$ at \f$z\f$.
 *
 * The AVI is a special case of a Variational Inequality (VI), where the
 * function \f$F\f$ is affine. For VI solvers, see \ref viProblem .
 *
 * From more details on theory and analysis of AVI (and VI in general), we refer to
 *
 * Facchinei, Francisco; Pang, Jong-Shi (2003),
 * <i>Finite Dimensional Variational Inequalities and Complementarity Problems</i>, Vol. 1 & 2,
 * Springer Series in Operations Research, Berlin-Heidelberg-New York: Springer-Verlag.
 *
 *  \section aviSolversList Available solvers

  The solvers and their parameters are described in \ref AVISolvers. \n
  Use the generic function AVI_driver() to call one the the specific solvers listed below:

    - avi_caoferris(), direct solver for AVI based on pivoting method principle for degenerate problem.\n
  Choice of pivot variable is performed via lexicographic ordering

  (see also the functions/solvers list in AVI_Solvers.h and numbering in AVI_cst.h)
