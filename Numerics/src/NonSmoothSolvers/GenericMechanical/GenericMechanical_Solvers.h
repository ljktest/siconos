This page gives an overview of the available solvers for friction-contact (3D) problems and their required parameters.

For each solver, the input argument are:
- a FrictionContactProblem
- the unknowns (reaction,velocity)
- info, the termination value (0: convergence, >0 problem which depends on the solver)
- a SolverOptions structure, which handles iparam and dparam
