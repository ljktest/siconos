/*! \page NSDrivers  Non-Smooth Solvers

Numerics package proposes a set of non-smooth solvers dedicated to some specific formulations for a non-smooth problem.\n

For each type of problem, a generic interface function (driver) is provided. \n
The main arguments of this driver are:
 - a structure of type XXX_Problem (XXX being the formulation type: LinearComplementarity_Problem, FrictionContact_Problem ...), which holds the vectors and matrices used to formalize the problem, \n
 - the unknowns \n
 - a structure of type Solver_Options, used to defined the solver type and its parameters (see \ref NumericsSolver). \n
 - a Numerics_Options structure, used to define global options (verbose mode ...)

To get more details on each formulation, check for each type of problem in \ref NSSpackContents below.

All the drivers interfaces are defined in the file NonSmoothDrivers.h .\n
Each type of formulation is defined in a structure in the file XXX_Problem.h .
