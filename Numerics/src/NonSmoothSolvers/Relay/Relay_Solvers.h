/*! \page RelaySolvers Relay Problems Solvers

This page gives an overview of the available solvers for relay problems and their required parameters.

For each solver, the input argument are:
- a Relay_Problem
- the unknowns (z,w)
- info, the termination value (0: convergence, >0 problem which depends on the solver)
- a Solver_Options structure, which handles iparam and dparam

Note: function names starting with dr -> dual relay, with pr: primal relay

\section relayLatin Latin
LArge Time INcrements solver

\bf function: pr_latin() or dr_latin() \n
\bf parameters:
- iparam[0] (in): maximum number of iterations allowed
- iparam[1] (out): number of iterations processed
- dparam[0] (in): tolerance
- dparam[1] (out): resulting error
- dparam[2] (in): latin parameter

\section relayNLGS Non-linear Gauss Seidel
LArge Time INcrements solver

\bf function: pr_nlgs() or dr_nlgs()\n
\bf parameters:
- iparam[0] (in): maximum number of iterations allowed
- iparam[1] (out): number of iterations processed
- dparam[0] (in): tolerance
- dparam[1] (out): resulting error
