/*! \page RelayProblem Primal or Dual Relay problems
  \section relayIntro The problem
  Two formulations are available, primal and dual problems.

  Try \f$(z,w)\f$ such that:\n

  <em>primal problem:</em>\n

  \f$
  \left\lbrace
  \begin{array}{l}
  w = M z + q \\
  -w \in N_{[lb, ub]}(z)\\
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \f$

  or

  <em>dual problem:</em>\n
  \f$
  \left\lbrace
  \begin{array}{l}
  w = M z + q\\
  -z \in N_{[lb,ub]}(w)\\
  \end{array}
  \right.
  \f$

  here M is an (\f$ n \times n \f$)-matrix, q an n-dimensional vector, z an n-dimensional  vector and w an n-dimensional vector.

  The solvers and their parameters are described in \ref relaySolvers . \n

  \section prSolversList Available solvers for primal case

  Use the generic function pr_solver(), to call one the the specific solvers listed below:

  - pr_latin(), latin solver for primal relay problems.
  - pr_nlgs(), non linear Gauss-Seidel solver for primal relay problems

  \section prSolversList Available solvers for dual case

  Use the generic function dr_solver(), to call one the the specific solvers listed below:

  - dr_latin(), latin (LArge Time INcrement)solver for dual relay problems.
  - dr_nlgs(), non linear Gauss-Seidel solver for dual relay problems

  (see the functions/solvers list in Relay_Solvers.h)
