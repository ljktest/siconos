/*! \page RelayProblem Relay or box-constrained AVI problems
  \section relayIntro The problem
  Find \f$(z,w)\f$ such that:
  \f[
  \left\lbrace
  \begin{array}{l}
  w = M z + q\\
  -z \in \mathcal{N}_{K}(w)\\
  \end{array},
  \right.
  \f]
  where M is an (\f$ n \times n \f$)-matrix, q, z and w are n-dimensional vectors, K is the box
  defined by \f$K=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n \mid lb_i \leq x_i \leq ub_i, i = 1, ..., n \}\f$ and
  \f$\mathcal{N}_K(w)\f$ is the normal cone to \f$K\f$ at \f$w\f$.

  The solvers and their parameters are described in \ref RelaySolvers. \n

  \section relaySolversList Available solvers

  The "direct" solvers are
  - relay_avi_caoferris based on an algorithm by Cao and Ferris for AVI with a polytopic set \f$K\f$.
  - relay_path using the PATH solver

  Using an LCP reformulation (splitting z in positive and negative part), we have the following
  available solvers:

  - relay_enum which solves the LCP using the enumerative method
  - relay_lexicolemke which solves the LCP using Lemke's algorithm

  (see the functions/solvers list in Relay_Solvers.h)
