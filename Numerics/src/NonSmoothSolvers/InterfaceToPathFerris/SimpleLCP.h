  \brief Interface for Path(Ferris) Solver
  \author Olivier Bonnefond

/*! \page FerrisPath Path (Ferris) Solver Interface

  The problem solved is:

  \f$ Mx + q  \perp l <= x <= u \f$

  M is a square matrix.  M should also be a positive semidefinite matrix.

  The LCP uses the (i, j, data) format for inputing sparse matrice (M).
  We adopt the FORTRAN convention that the indices begin at 1.

  Here is a description of each of the arguments to the LCP_Create functions:

  - variables - the number of variables in the problem
  - m_nnz - the number of nonzeros in the M matrix
  - m_i - a vector of size m_nnz containing the row indices for M
  - m_j - a vector of size m_nnz containing the column indices for M
  - m_ij - a vector of size m_nnz containing the data for M
  - q - a vector of size variables
  - lb - a vector of size variables containing the lower bounds on x
  - ub - a vector of size variables containing the upper bounds on x
