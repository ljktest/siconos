1. ODEPACK - A Systematized Collection of ODE Solvers </b>

<p>
ODEPACK is a collection of Fortran solvers for the initial value
problem for ordinary differential equation systems.  It consists of
nine solvers, namely a basic solver called LSODE and eight variants of
it -- LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR, LSODPK, LSODKR, LSODI, LSOIBT, and
LSODIS.  The collection is suitable for both stiff and nonstiff
systems.  It includes solvers for systems given in explicit form,
dy/dt = f(t,y), and also solvers for systems given in linearly
implicit form, A(t,y) dy/dt = g(t,y).  Two of the solvers use general
sparse matrix solvers for the linear systems that arise.  Two others
use iterative (preconditioned Krylov) methods instead of direct
methods for these linear systems.  The most recent addition is LSODIS,
which solves implicit problems with general sparse treatment of all
matrices involved.

<p>
The ODEPACK solvers are written in standard Fortran 77, with a few
exceptions, and with minimal machine dependencies.  There are separate
double and single precision versions of ODEPACK.  The actual solver
names are those given above with a prefix of D- or S- for the double
or single precision version, respectively, i.e. DLSODE/SLSODE, etc.
Each solver consists of a main driver subroutine having the same name
as the solver and some number of subordinate routines.  For each
solver, there is also a demonstration program, which solves one or two
simple problems in a somewhat self-checking manner.

<p>
Recently, the ODEPACK solvers were upgraded to improve their
portability in numerous ways.  Among the improvements are (a) renaming
of routines and Common blocks to distinguish double and single
precision versions, (b) use of generic intrinsic function names, (c)
elimination of the Block Data subprogram, (d) use of a portable
routine to set the unit roundoff, and (e) passing of quoted strings to
the error message handler.  In addition, the prologue and internal
comments were reformatted, and use mixed upper/lower case.  Numerous
minor corrections and improvements were also made.  

<p>
The above upgrade operations were applied to LSODE earlier than they
were to the rest of ODEPACK, and the two upgrades were done somewhat
independently.  As a result, some differences will be apparent in the
source files of LSODE and the other solvers -- primarily in the
formatting of the comment line prologue of the main driver routine.
In subroutines DLSODE/SLSODE and their subordinate routines, the
prologue was written in "SLATEC style", while for the other solvers a
more relaxed style was used.  The differences are entirely cosmetic,
however, and do not affect performance.

<p>
Documentation on the usage of each solver is provided in the initial
block of comment lines in the source file, which (in most cases)
includes a simple example.  A demonstration program (in seperate
double/single precision versions) is also available.

<p>
A more detailed summary of ODEPACK, together with notes on usage
documentation and installation, is supplied with the package.  See
also the papers [1], [2] (for LSODE), and [3] (for LSODPK and LSODKR).
(However, the document [2] does not reflect the upgrade operations
described above.)  For the convenience of users interested only in
LSODE, that solver is being made available separately, as described
below.


<p><br><b>

2. LSODE - SLSODE/DLSODE </b>

<p>
LSODE (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations) solves
stiff and nonstiff systems of the form dy/dt = f(t,y).  In the stiff
case, it treats the Jacobian matrix df/dy as either a dense (full) or
a banded matrix, and as either user-supplied or internally
approximated by difference quotients.  It uses Adams methods
(predictor-corrector) in the nonstiff case, and Backward
Differentiation Formula (BDF) methods (the Gear methods) in the stiff
case.  The linear systems that arise are solved by direct methods (LU
factor/solve).  LSODE supersedes the older GEAR and GEARB packages,
and reflects a complete redesign of the user interface and internal
organization, with some algorithmic improvements.

<p>
LSODE is available in separate double and single precision versions,
called DLSODE and SLSODE.  Documentation on the usage of DLSODE/SLSODE
is provided in the initial block of comment lines in the source file,
which includes a simple example.  A demonstration program (in seperate
double/single precision versions) is also available.


<p><br><b>

3. VODE - SVODE/DVODE </b>

<p>
VODE is a general purpose solver very similar to LSODE.  However, it
uses variable-coefficient methods (fixed-leading coefficient form)
instead of the fixed-step-interpolate methods in LSODE.  This and
other features make it often more efficient than LSODE [4].  VODE is
available in separate double and single precision versions, DVODE and
SVODE.  Documentation on the usage of DVODE/SVODE is provided in the
initial block of comment lines in the source file, which includes a
simple example.  A demonstration program is also available.

<p><br><b>

4. VODPK - DVODPK/SVODPK </b>

<p>
VODPK is a variant of VODE which uses Preconditioned Krylov methods
(which are iterative) for the linear systems that arise, instead of
the direct methods in VODE.  See [3] and [5].  VODPK is available in
separate double and single precision versions, DVODPK and SVODPK.
Documentation on the usage of DVODPK/SVODPK is provided in the initial
block of comment lines in the source file, which includes a simple
example.  A demonstration program is also available.

<p><br><b>

5. GEARBI </b>

<p>
GEARBI is a variant of the older GEAR package (predecessor to LSODE).
It solves stiff and nonstiff systems, using BDF and Adams methods.
The unique feature of GEARBI is that, in the case of stiff systems, it
uses a block-iterative method, Block-SOR, to solve the linear systems
that arise at each time step.  GEARBI is designed for use on problems
that arise from the spatial discretization of PDE systems, such that
the resulting ODE system has a regular block structure.

<p>
The original version of GEARBI, described and documented in [6], has
been modified for the version here.  The primary modification is in
the treatment of the off-diagonal blocks of the Jacobian matrix.
The new version assumes no structure for these blocks, but requires
a user-supplied routine to compute matrix-vector products involving
block-rows of the Jacobian, with the diagonal blocks excluded.

<p>
The GEARBI solver is provided in separate single and double precision
versions.  Both have a driver routine, called DRIVBI.  Documentation
on the usage of GEARBI is provided in the initial block of comment
lines in the source file.  An example program, with a sample output,
is also supplied for each precision.

<p><br><b>

6. KRYSI </b>

<p>
KRYSI is a solver for stiff systems, and is a variant of an implicit
Runge-Kutta solver called SIMPLE.  Both KRYSI and SIMPLE use the same
3-stage third order SDIRK method.  But where SIMPLE uses a direct
(dense) solver for the associated linear systems, KRYSI uses a
preconditioned Krylov method (preconditioned GMRES iteration).
See [7] for details.

<p>
The KRYSI solver is provided in separate single and double precision
versions.  Documentation on the usage of KRYSI is provided in the
initial block of comment lines in the source file.  An example
program, with a sample output, is also supplied for each precision.
