  Typedef and functions declarations related to projection solver for 3 dimension frictional contact problems

  Each solver must have 4 functions in its interface:
  - initialize: link global static variables to the considered problem (M,q,...)
  - update: link/fill the local variables corresponding to sub-blocks of the full problem, for a specific contact
  - solve: solve the local problem
  - free

  We consider a "global" (ie for several contacts) problem, used to initialize the static global variables.
  Then a "local" (ie for one contact => size = 3) problem is built (update function) and solved (solve function).

  Two different storages are available for M: dense and sparse block. Initialize and update calls depend on this storage.
  SBS (Sparse Block Storage) is added to the name of functions dedicated to Sparse storage for M.
